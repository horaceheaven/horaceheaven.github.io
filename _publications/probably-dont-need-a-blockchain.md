## You proabably don't need a Blockchain

One of the most talked about aspects of Bitcoin is the Blockchain. The Blockchain is the data structure used for storing Bitcoin transactions. Though, essential to Bitcoin’s functionality. It has often been taken and forcefully applied to other use cases that arguably do not require a Blockchain. Most of these projects are better off using an immutable database. Even worse, tokens are associated with some of these chains. These tokens can often be viewed as unregistered securities, and meet the criteria of the Howey Test. My view is, there only needs to be one Blockchain, which is Bitcoin. Other innovations in the space can be built on top of Bitcoin to leverage its immutable and decentralized abilities. A popular example of this innovation is the [Lightning Network](https://lightning.network/).

Bitcoin is different technologies and concepts brought together for it to operate. Each of which is applied carefully in the right proportion for the network to function. Namely, proof of work, game theory, asymmetric cryptography, distributed systems, economics, and so on. Building a Blockchain that is not decentralized and not engraved with the game theory incentive for computational proof of work defeats the entire purpose of Blockchain.

*“Show me the incentive, and I’ll show you the outcome” – Charlie Munger*

The key reason for the continuation of the Bitcoin Blockchain is the block reward incentives. Bitcoin is anchored into the physical space by the energy necessary to mine Bitcoins. Energy is not a free resource. However, Bitcoin miners are incentivized for expanding energy in the form of computational proof of work to secure the network. This is a very important part of Bitcoin’s Game Theory. Game Theory is significant in shaping the behaviour of participants in the network. Because of the game theory, It's beneficial for participants to cooperate and support the network. As computation is not free, and transitively, energy is not free. Energy is the ultimate physical constraint that protects the Bitcoin network in cyberspace.
